 # Portfolio construction strategy 
 We are going to build our portfolios on the following criteria:
 
 * Based on investors risk tolerance level - depending on the risk aversion (A) index [we can look at the age]
 * The formula requires not only know the security's performance, but also its volatility (or risk) and one's own aversion to risk, on a scale of 1 to 5

 * Investor type - Value (undervalued securities) 
 * Resources he/she has - money (savings, emergency fund)
 * Country choice
 * Tax residency status 
 * Ask them which investment instrument he/she avoid or prefer 
 * Put the investor in a group based on the criteria above 
    * looking for rapid growth (rapid growth in prices) in market variables - 'high risk high return vice versa'
    * looking for moderate risk return investment - 'risk mutual'
    * looking for value investment - 'risk averse (low risk) person'
 
 1.Design the form: How do we define the person is high risk/low risk/moderate risk investor
 2.#def:return_personatype("age", "savings", "range of grwoth") calculate risk aversion index  
 3.#def    

 We are going to take the following steps:
 
 This is how we will do the instrument allocation:

 This is how we will select the instruments:
 
 We will provide the following:

 1. mimic strategy - benchmark soros etc  
 2. high risk  strategy -   
 3. low risk strategy
 4. high liquid
 5. least liquid

 1. Risk 
 2. Reward
 3. Liquidity 

Portfolio construction strategy: 
1. Selection of instruments 
a. country - US (NASDAQ), Australia (ASX200), 
b. add shares, bonds, crypto, ETF
2. Weightings 
a. risk calculations (SD)

Usually, bsed on the investors risk aversion or toelrance level, we select instruments which has high risk high retunr or low risk low return or based on the portoflio theory

List of topics:
1. Montecarlo
2. Standard Deviation (we need variance, correlation/covariance) 
3. Sharpe ratio
4. Dashboard
5. Pandas
