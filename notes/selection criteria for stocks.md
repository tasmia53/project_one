* Return on capital or Return on Equity (ROE) - is a measure of business profitability and is calculated as the ratio of net income to equity (NI/TE) (the company’s assets, net of debts and other liabilities). Higher ROE indicates a better performance, however, sometimes it may also indicates company is highly levered. 

* Price/earnings ratio (P/E) - The most widely used indicator by those seeking to approach the analysis (and choice) of securities according to the fundamental criteria. A stock with low P/E expected to provide higher return in the short run but as a low P/E indicates that you are “paying less” for the company’s earnings, so the stock in question is affordable but it could also mean that future earnings expectations are not particularly positive.

* Price/book value ratio (P/B) - relates the stock price with the value of the net assets resulting from the latest financial statements. A ratio of less than 1 means that you are paying the company less than the value of the balance sheet assets net of liabilities, but this does not automatically mean that you are also making a deal, at least until you verify the company’s ability to produce profits.

* Beta (systematic risk or non-diversifiable risk indicator) - Beta less than one is less riskier than the market. But it is logical to expect that in growth phases of the market high beta stocks are preferable, and vice versa, but not always. The beta can therefore be used profitably more as a control parameter or in combination with other extraction filters.

* Dividend yield - The dividend yield, expressed as a percentage, is a financial ratio (dividend/price) that shows how much a company pays out in dividends each year relative to its stock price. A healthy company is generally able to distribute dividends to remunerate its shareholders, the dividend yield measures the ability to do so. However, in some cases, a high dividend yield may indicate little reinvestment or poor growth prospects.
